The new security rules would require our containers to run as unprivileged user (versus running as root, which is the docker default), as well as run with a read only root filesystem. It is straight forward enough to run containers as non root user&hellip; we just need a line to <code>RUN addusr</code>, include the <code>--chown appuser:appuser</code> with all the <code>COPY</code> directives in our dockerfile, and finish nicely with <code>USER appuser</code> or something like that. Getting around the read-only filesystem constraints are a bit trickier, as typically the framework is doing things for us which are not obvious to use in day-to-day development.</p>

<p>In our work setup we have a bunch of microservices running dotnet core, and one running node. None of our containers ran into any issues running as the non-root user. However, all of them had niggles running on a read only filesystem. The dotnet containers gave us a cryptic <code>Failed to initialize CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x80004005</code>. A little bit of googling revealed that this had to do with dotnet trying to initialize a debugging tool which required access to write to a tmp directory. Disabling this tool needed an environment variable to be set, ala <code>ENV COMPlus_EnableDiagnostics 0</code>. Easy win! Many thanks.</p>

<p>It took a bit longer to figure out the node container, which had an ENTRYPOINT of <code>[&quot;yarn&quot;, &quot;start&quot;]</code>. The start script simply ran <code>node server.js</code>. The logged error complained that yarn did not have access to the cache directory and that yarn should be run with the &ndash;cache-folder parameter. This was a little misleading and we ended up trying many permutations of this parameter in conjunction with &ndash;pure-lockfile and &ndash;frozen-lockfile. All a bit of a wild goose chase. In the end, I learnt that yarn runs all things with the use of a cache, hence it&rsquo;s really not feasible to launch a process on a RO-FS using yarn. The seemingly OK solution was just to change the ENTRYPOINT to [&ldquo;node&rdquo;, &ldquo;server.js&rdquo;].</p>

<p>Being that the feedback loop of trying this out on the CI is about 30 minutes, I spent a good half of a day figuring this out. Later in the night I realized how much time I could have saved if I had known that <code>docker run</code> accepted a <code>--read-only</code> parameter, which could be used to reproduce the issue as experienced on CI. Ahh!</p>
